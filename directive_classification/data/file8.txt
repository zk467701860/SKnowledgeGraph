 Subclasses may extend but must call the super implementation.	__label__MethodExtensionDirective
 Subclasses may call super as in the following example:	__label__MethodExtensionDirective
 All subclasses must call this method when their control is first established.	__label__CallContractSubclassingDirective
 Subclasses may call the following methods to configure the wizard:      * addPage     * setHelpAvailable     * setDefaultPageImageDescriptor     * setDialogSettings     * setNeedsProgressMonitor     * setTitleBarColor     * setWindowTitle	__label__CallContractSubclassingDirective
 Subclasses that support fields should override this and create an AttributedCharacterIterator with meaningful attributes.	__label__CallContractSubclassingDirective
 Subclasses MUST use try ...finally as follows to ensure that the busy flag is reset to its original value:   boolean oldBusy = isBusy();  setBusy(true);  try {   // do work  } finally {   setBusy(oldBusy);  }	__label__CallContractSubclassingDirective
 This method should be called by implementers of ILazyTreeContentProvider to populate this viewer.	__label__CallContractSubclassingDirective
 If the ThreadGroup object has no special requirements for dealing with the exception, it can forward the invocation to the {@linkplain #getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler default uncaught exception handler}.	__label__CallContractSubclassingDirective
 When processing logging output, if a Handler encounters problems then rather than throwing an Exception back to the issuer of the logging call (who is unlikely to be interested) the Handler should call its associated ErrorManager.	__label__CallContractSubclassingDirective
 If the scale is reduced by the operation, the unscaled value must be divided (rather than multiplied), and the value may be changed; in this case, the specified rounding mode is applied to the division.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 In other words, this method must allocate a new array	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 The general contract for the Object.equals method states that equals must be symmetric (in other words, a.equals(b) if and only if b.equals(a)).	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 BasicPermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them to be inserted in any order,	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 Creating a type variable must not cause the creation of its bounds. Repeated creation of a type variable has no effect.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that either a complementary substitution must be made during deserialization or that the substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference will be stored.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 A Key should use KeyRep as its serialized representation.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 The hashCode method of the returned set returns the sum of the identity hashcodes of the elements in the set, rather than the sum of their hashcodes. This is mandated by the change in the semantics of the equals method, in order to enforce the general contract of the Object.hashCode method among sets returned by this method.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 This method simply informs the group's monitor that the object is inactive. It is up to the concrete subclass of ActivationGroup to fulfill the additional requirement of unexporting the object.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 The byte array will be in big-endian byte-order: the most significant byte is in the zeroth element. The array will contain the minimum number of bytes required to represent this BigInteger, including at least one sign bit, which is { (ceil((this.bitLength() + 1)/8))}.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this exception if fromElement or toElement cannot be compared to elements currently in the set	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this exception if { toKey} cannot be compared to keys currently in the map.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 If the protocol of this URL is "jar", then the permission granted is based on the permission that is required by the URL of the Jar file.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap} method.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 This test must be fast and optimistic i.e. it is OK to return true even though there might be no quick fix.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 If the security property is not set, the provider is assumed to have alternative means for obtaining authentication information.	__label__MethodImplementationDirective
 If you reimplement this method, you should also reimplement updateContents.	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 An implementation of this interface should implement {@link Object#equals} to return true when passed an instance that represents the same (functionally equivalent) server socket factory, and false otherwise (and it should also implement {@link Object#hashCode} consistently with its Object.equals implementation).	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 The general contract for write(b) is that it should have exactly the same effect as the call write(b, 0, b.length).	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 The natural ordering for a class C is said to be consistent with equals if and only if e1.compareTo(e2) == 0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals(e2) for every e1 and e2 of class C.	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 The visibility of the details button is controlled by {@link #shouldShowDetailsButton()}, which should also be overridden together with this method.	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 Implementors of {@link ColumnViewer} have to provide a concrete implementation for the underlying widget	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 An implementation of this interface must define a compareTo method that provides an ordering consistent with its getDelay method	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface.	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 This API is only valid if the information control implements {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.IInformationControlExtension3}. Not following this restriction will later result in an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 A character may start a Unicode identifier if and only if one of the following conditions is true:      {@link #isLetter(int) isLetter(codePoint)} returns true     {@link #getType(int) getType(codePoint)} returns LETTER_NUMBER.	__label__Non-localConsistencySubclassingDirective
 If you reimplement this method, you should also reimplement createContents.	__label__MiscellaneousSubclassingDirective
 The resolveClass method in the corresponding subclass of ObjectInputStream must read and use any data or objects written by annotateClass	__label__MiscellaneousSubclassingDirective
 When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that either a complementary substitution must be made during deserialization or that the substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference will be stored.	__label__MiscellaneousSubclassingDirective
 ObjectInputStream subclasses which override this method can only be constructed in security contexts possessing the "enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission; any attempt to instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a SecurityException to be thrown.	__label__MiscellaneousSubclassingDirective
 It must be {@linkplain java.io.PipedWriter#connect( java.io.PipedReader) connected} to a PipedWriter before being used.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 You must add at least one Comparator before calling the compare(Object,Object) method	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 The client must also make a dirty call to renew leases on remote references before such leases expire	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 A failed dirty call must schedule a strong clean call so that the call's sequence number can be retained in order to detect future calls received out of order by the distributed garbage collector	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 This should be called whenever needsInput() returns true indicating that more input data is required.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 At a minimum, the recovery operation must include closing the current connection and getting a new connection.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 This method will only work when it is invoked after the control of the dialog has been set	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 The option must be enabled prior to entering the blocking operation to have effect.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 applet should avoid calling methods in java.applet.Applet in the constructor.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 This method may only be called after initializeDialogUnits has been called.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 HTTP protocol implementers should make sure that this method is called after all request headers related to choosing cookies are added, and before the request is sent.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 All OUT parameters must be registered before a stored procedure is executed.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 This method must be called before any of the dialog unit based conversion methods are called.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 This method can be called once per call to next().	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 Note: {@link ListIterator} implementations that support add() and remove() only allow set() to be called once per call to next() or previous (see the {@link ListIterator} javadoc for more details).	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 You will normally use {@link #addIterator(Iterator)} to add some more iterators after using this constructor.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 If an activatable object requires restart services, use one of the ActivationDesc constructors that takes a boolean parameter, restart.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 As the ILazyContentProvider does not have API for determining the total item count any changes to the number of items for this object while require a call to #setItemCount on the viewer that uses it.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 Note that the dialog will have no visual representation (no widgets) until it is told to open.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 Prior to 3.0 this method can only be called once. Since 3.0 this method can be called again after a call to {@link ISourceViewerExtension2#unconfigure()}.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 Note that all preference nodes must be dispose their resources. The node must dispose the page managed by this node, and any SWT resources allocated by this node (Images, Fonts, etc). However the node itself may be reused.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 If the resource is intended to live for entire lifetime of the resource manager, a subsequent call to {@link #destroy(DeviceResourceDescriptor)} may be omitted and the resource will be cleaned up when the resource manager is disposed. This pattern is useful for short-lived {@link LocalResourceManager}s, but should never be used with the global resource manager since doing so effectively leaks the resource.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 If fork is set to false, the runnable will run in the UI thread and it is the runnable's responsibility to call Display.readAndDispatch() to ensure UI responsiveness.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 In other words, if this method were to be called twice in succession, the second call would return false (unless the current thread were interrupted again, after the first call had cleared its interrupted status and before the second call had examined it).	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 This method can only be called once the connection has been completely verified by reading from the input stream until the end of the stream has been reached.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 Once the client is done with a wizard node, its disposemethod must be called to free up the wizard; once disposes, the node should no longer be used.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 It is important not to use the original set after invoking this method, as it is a backdoor for adding untransformed objects.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 It is important not to use the original bag after invoking this method, as it is a backdoor for adding invalid objects.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 Must be called before start. May again be called between start and stop.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 This method must be called before this window's shell is created.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 Note that multiple calls to formatterStarts can be issued to a strategy before launching the formatting process with format.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 Calling this method has no effect after createPartControl is called.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective
 In this case, these tasks will only terminate upon shutdownNow, or after setting the policy to false when already shutdown.	__label__MethodCallSequenceDirective

 After invoking this method the file or directory is guaranteed not to change until it is either deleted or marked to allow write access.	__label__NonCall-basedStateDirective
 Subclasses should override this method when an alternate default location is desired, rather than overriding {@link #getInitialLocation(Point)}	__label__AlternativeDirective
 Instead, an application should register an activation descriptor and export a remote object separately, so that exceptions can be handled properly.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 Note: this method should not be used for file-locking, as the resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The {@link java.nio.channels.FileLock FileLock} facility should be used instead.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 Inheritable thread-local variables are used in preference to ordinary thread-local variables when the per-thread-attribute being maintained in the variable (e.g., User ID, Transaction ID) must be automatically transmitted to any child threads that are created.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 This interface is used only for computations that throw checked exceptions; computations that do not throw checked exceptions should use PrivilegedAction instead.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names, EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names. They should be specified using the {@link #addPathToName(int type, byte [] name) addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)} method.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 The getLogWriter and setLogWriter methods should be used instead of the get/setlogStream methods, which are deprecated.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 The {@link java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder} class should be used when more control over the encoding process is required.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 The {@link java.nio.charset.CharsetDecoder} class should be used when more control over the decoding process is required.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 An application might use the activeGroupCount method to get an estimate of how big the array should be, however if the array is too short to hold all the thread groups, the extra thread groups are silently ignored.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 . The modifiers consist of the Java Virtual Machine's constants for public, protected, private, final, static, abstract and interface; they should be decoded using the methods of class Modifier.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 Sometimes a security check that should be made within a given context will actually need to be done from within a different context (for example, from within a worker thread). The {@link SecurityManager#getSecurityContext getSecurityContext} method and the {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission(java.security.Permission, java.lang.Object) checkPermission} method that includes a context argument are provided for this situation.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 Please use {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.ListenerList} instead.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 Also note that the equivalent of {@link #ListenerList()} is actually {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.ListenerList#ListenerList(int)} with {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.ListenerList#IDENTITY} as the argument.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 Label providers for table viewers must implement either the ITableLabelProvider or the ILabelProvider interface (see TableViewer.setLabelProvider for more details).	__label__AlternativeDirective
 Label providers for table tree viewers must implement either the ITableLabelProvider or the ILabelProvider interface (see TableTreeViewer.setLabelProvider for more details).	__label__AlternativeDirective
 Note that LRUMap is not synchronized and is not thread-safe. If you wish to use this map from multiple threads concurrently, you must use appropriate synchronization. The simplest approach is to wrap this map using {@link java.util.Collections#synchronizedMap(Map)}.	__label__AlternativeDirective

 Clients are encouraged to use the value returned from this method instead of constructing a new instance to reduce allocation and garbage collection overhead when multiple BooleanComparators may be used in the same virtual machine.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 The three forms of { park} each also support a { blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker}.) The use of these forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a { blocker} within a lock implementation is { this}.	__label__AlternativeDirective

 These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves useful for most concurrency control applications.	__label__AlternativeDirective
 This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result.	__label__AlternativeDirective

 Note that this implementation is not synchronized.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 The cursor enables iteration and list changes to occur in any order without invalidating the iterator (from one thread).	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 Iterators must be manually synchronized.   synchronized (coll) {    Iterator it = coll.iterator();    // do stuff with iterator  }    @return an iterator that must be manually synchronized on the collection	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned sorted set when iterating over it or any of its subSet, headSet, or tailSet views.    SortedSet s = Collections.synchronizedSortedSet(new TreeSet());       ...   synchronized(s) {       Iterator i = s.iterator(); // Must be in the synchronized block       while (i.hasNext())           foo(i.next());   }	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 All PolicyQualifierInfo objects must be immutable and thread-safe.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 If the Collection will be modified by one thread while another thread is calling a method of a Collection CertStore that has been initialized with this Collection, the Collection must have fail-fast iterators.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 Concurrent modifications are not directly supported, and for most collection implementations will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 Note that TransformedSortedMap is not synchronized and is not thread-safe. If you wish to use this map from multiple threads concurrently, you must use appropriate synchronization.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 If multiple threads access a linked hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 Note that this implementation is not synchronized.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 If multiple threads access an enum set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 If multiple threads access an enum map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map, it should be synchronized externally.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 All TrustAnchor objects must be immutable and thread-safe.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will likely vary from one JRE implementation to another. In light of this variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required, and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on which an application is to run.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 The absence of block-structured locking removes the automatic release of locks that occurs with { synchronized} methods and statements. In most cases, the following idiom should be used:	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 Thread-safe implementation. Can be called from any thread.	__label__SynchronizationDirective
 If your application needs to set a different security manager, you must ensure that the policy file specified by the group's ActivationGroupDesc grants the group the necessary permissions to set a new security manager	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If your application requires specific properties to be set when objects are activated in the group, the application should create a special Properties object containing these properties, then create an ActivationGroupDesc with the Properties object, and use ActivationGroup.createGroup before creating any ActivationDescs (before the default ActivationGroupDesc is created).	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The Appendable interface must be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to receive formatted output from a {@link java.util.Formatter}.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 To create a custom mapping, a programmer must do two things:      * create a class that implements the {@link SQLData} interface for the UDT to be custom mapped.     * make an entry in a type map that contains           o the fully-qualified SQL type name of the UDT           o the Class object for the class implementing SQLData	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Each class that implements PrivilegedExceptionAction should document what (if anything) this value represents.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are possible, and this method should always be used in a loop:       synchronized (obj) {          while (<condition does not hold>)              obj.wait();          ... // Perform action appropriate to condition      }	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 An implementation should document when this is the case.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 For some memory pools, for example, when objects are not packed contiguously, this method may be an expensive operation that requires some computation to determine the current memory usage. An implementation should document when this is the case.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Environment variables should be used when a global effect is desired, or when an external system interface requires an environment variable (such as PATH).	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 When a client application is designed to remotely access MXBeans for a running virtual machine whose version is different than the version on which the application is running, it should prepare to catch {@link java.io.InvalidObjectException InvalidObjectException} which is thrown when an MXBean proxy receives a name of an enum constant which is missing in the enum class loaded in the client application.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If they are not then they must not be changed after adding to the MultiKey.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Implementation note: This method requires a lot of time and a ton of stack space. Essentially a recursive algorithm is used to enter each bucket's monitor. If you have twenty thousand buckets in your map, then the recursive method will be invoked twenty thousand times. You have been warned.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 From a performance standpoint, these methods should be used with caution. In many implementations they will perform costly linear searches.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The add methods are affected by this class. Thus objects must be removed or searched for using their transformed form. For example, if the transformation converts Strings to Integers, you must use the Integer form to remove objects.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective

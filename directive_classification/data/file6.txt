 Subclasses must implement this framework method to paint images within the given bounds using one or more calls to the drawImage framework method.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 If this method is overridden, the method that overrides it should additionally check to see if the calling thread has the RuntimePermission("modifyThread") permission, and if so, return silently.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Subclasses are required to call {@link #create()} at the end of their constructor.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 May be called from subclasses that override {@link #initialize(ColumnViewer, ViewerColumn)} but want to customize whether owner draw will be enabled.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Subclasses could populate additional entry fields.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Implementation of this method must finish their computation by setting the computation results using setInformation.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 In other words, this method must allocate a new array	__label__SubclassingDirective
 They therefore must either be parsed as such or treated as an error.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 This map enforces the restriction that there is a 1:1 relation between keys and values, meaning that multiple keys cannot map to the same value. This is required so that "inverting" the map results in a map without duplicate keys.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 If markpos is not -1, then all bytes from positions buf[markpos] through buf[pos-1] must remain in the buffer array	__label__SubclassingDirective
 . Should only succeed once per remote call.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 The retransformation must not add, remove or rename fields or methods, change the signatures of methods, or change inheritance.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 This differs from {@link List#removeAll(Collection)} in that cardinality is respected; if list1 contains two occurrences of null and list2 only contains one occurrence, then the returned list will still contain one occurrence.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 The driver stores the value specified in a suitable location in the database. For example in a special register, session parameter, or system table column. For efficiency the driver may defer setting the value in the database until the next time a statement is executed or prepared. Other than storing the client information in the appropriate place in the database, these methods shall not alter the behavior of the connection in anyway. The values supplied to these methods are used for accounting, diagnostics and debugging purposes only.  The driver shall generate a warning if the client info name specified is not recognized by the driver.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 If the identity has a public key, the public key in the certificate must be the same, and if the identity does not have a public key, the identity's public key is set to be that specified in the certificate.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this exception if { fromElement} or { toElement} cannot be compared to elements currently in the set.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this exception if { fromKey} or { toKey} cannot be compared to keys currently in the map.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 The hash code of a list is defined to be the result of the following calculation:    int hashCode = 1;   Iterator<E> i = list.iterator();   while (i.hasNext()) {       E obj = i.next();       hashCode = 31*hashCode + (obj==null ? 0 : obj.hashCode());   }    This ensures that list1.equals(list2) implies that list1.hashCode()==list2.hashCode() for any two lists, list1 and list2, as required by the general contract of {@link Object#hashCode}.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 If the protocol of this URL is "jar", then the permission granted is based on the permission that is required by the URL of the Jar file.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedMap} method.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 While Deque implementations are not strictly required to prohibit the insertion of null elements, they are strongly encouraged to do so.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Generic list algorithms are encouraged to check whether the given list is an instanceof this interface before applying an algorithm that would provide poor performance if it were applied to a sequential access list, and to alter their behavior if necessary to guarantee acceptable performance.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 This set will not contain the element once the call returns	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Subclasses that change the layout type by overriding this method should also override createContents.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 By convention, classes that implement this interface should override Object.clone (which is protected) with a public method.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 The Bindings instances that are returned must be identical to those returned by the getBindings method of ScriptContext called with corresponding arguments on the default ScriptContext of the ScriptEngine.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Implementors of {@link ColumnViewer} have to provide a concrete implementation for the underlying widget	__label__SubclassingDirective
 The output should be equivalent the following invocation of {@link String#toUpperCase(java.util.Locale)} out.toUpperCase()	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Subclasses of Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to be initialized.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Subclasses must define the protected methods that change this state, and which define what that state means in terms of this object being acquired or released.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)" to that instance.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 Decimal formats are generally not synchronized. It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.	__label__SubclassingDirective
 It must be {@linkplain java.io.PipedWriter#connect( java.io.PipedReader) connected} to a PipedWriter before being used.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 A return value of 0 indicates that needsInput() or needsDictionary() should be called	__label__MethodCallDirective
 To avoid continual thread replacement, the keep-alive time must be greater than zero when setting true.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 This method may only be called after initializeDialogUnits has been called.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 It must be connected to a piped reader, either by the receiver or the sender, before being used.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 It must be connected to a piped input stream, either by the receiver or the sender, before being used.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 In the second case, the permission should be obtained and tested before connecting.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 HTTP protocol implementers should make sure that this method is called after all request headers related to choosing cookies are added, and before the request is sent.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 All OUT parameters must be registered before a stored procedure is executed.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 The execute method executes an SQL statement and indicates the form of the first result. You must then use the methods getResultSet or getUpdateCount to retrieve the result, and getMoreResults to move to any subsequent result(s)	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Once it has downloaded the bytes that make up the class, it should use the method {@link #defineClass defineClass} to create a class instance.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 This method should be called when the decompressor is no longer being used, but will also be called automatically by the finalize() method.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from the semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Purges stale mappings from this map before write operations.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 @throws IllegalStateException if the next method has not yet been called, or the remove method has already been called after the last call to the next method.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 The keys should be immutable If they are not then they must not be changed after adding to the MultiKey.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 The encoding should be set before any LogRecords are written to the Handler.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Constructs a new FilterListIterator that will not function until {@link #setListIterator(ListIterator) setListIterator} and {@link #setPredicate(Predicate) setPredicate} are invoked.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Constructs a new TransformIterator that will not function until the {@link #setIterator(Iterator) setIterator} and {@link #setTransformer(Transformer)} methods are invoked.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 @throws IllegalStateException If {@link #next()} or {@link #previous()} haven't been called, or if the node has been removed with {@link #remove()} or a new node added with {@link #add(Object)}.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Events are not generated when preferences are modified in descendants of this node; a caller desiring such events must register with each descendant.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Must be called before paint is called the first time.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 In other words, if this method were to be called twice in succession, the second call would return false (unless the current thread were interrupted again, after the first call had cleared its interrupted status and before the second call had examined it).	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Once a socket has been closed, it is not available for further networking use (i.e. can't be reconnected or rebound). A new socket needs to be created.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Once the shell is created, it must be disposed (i.e., closed) before this method can be called.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 TableViewer#replace(Object, int) is not called before returning from this method selections may have missing or stale elements. In this situation it is suggested that the selection is asked for again after he update.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 After free has been called, any attempt to invoke a method other than free will result in a SQLException being thrown.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by invoking the {@link #halt halt} method, which forcibly terminates the virtual machine.  Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a new shutdown hook or de-register a previously-registered hook. Attempting either of these operations will cause an {@link IllegalStateException} to be thrown.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 The caller principal must be an owner of the ACL in order to invoke this method.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 For each certificate cert in a certification path certPath, cert.getType().equals(certPath.getType()) must be true.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 ComparatorChains cannot be modified once they have performed a comparison.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 the composited map does not not permit null keys (optional).	__label__MethodCallDirective
 @throws UnsupportedOperationException if a comparison has already been made	__label__MethodCallDirective
 With strict parsing, inputs must match this object's format.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 This target must be editable.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 Requires {@link StyledCellLabelProvider} with owner draw enabled.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 @exception SecurityException if a security manager exists and its checkMulticast method doesn't allow the join.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result.	__label__MethodCallDirective
 You must call either the method getResultSet or getUpdateCount to retrieve the result	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Client implementations of dispatchEvent and client-defined KeyEventDispatchers must call redispatchEvent(target, e) instead of target.dispatchEvent(e) to dispatch an event.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The new {@link #divide(BigDecimal, RoundingMode)} method should be used in preference to this legacy method.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 It is recommended to subclass this class instead of Dialog in all cases except where the dialog should never show a tray.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Instead, an application should register an activation descriptor and export a remote object separately, so that exceptions can be handled properly.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective

 Security note: If an application needs to read a password or other secure data, it should use {@link #readPassword()} or {@link #readPassword(String, Object...)} and manually zero the returned character array after processing to minimize the lifetime of sensitive data in memory.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Standard customers should not overwrite this method but {@link #getValue(Object)}	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 An application can call {@link #PKIXParameters(Set) PKIXParameters(Set)}, specifying a Set of TrustAnchor objects, each of which identify a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call {@link #PKIXParameters(KeyStore) PKIXParameters(KeyStore)}, specifying a KeyStore instance containing trusted certificate entries, each of which will be considered as a most-trusted CA.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Subclasses do not typically override this method, but implement setSelectionToWidget(List, boolean) instead.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Most programmers should use the {@link #toString} method in preference to this one, as the toString method may return a more user-friendly name.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The {@link java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder} class should be used when more control over the encoding process is required.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The {@link java.nio.charset.CharsetDecoder} class should be used when more control over the decoding process is required.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The {@link java.nio.charset.CharsetDecoder} class should be used when more control over the decoding process is required.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 In general, {@link java.lang.String#toLowerCase()} should be used to map characters to lowercase.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 In general, {@link java.lang.String#toUpperCase()} should be used to map characters to uppercase.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Completion proposals can implement {@link ICompletionProposalExtension6} to provide colored proposal labels.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Since this implementation does not support add() or remove(), set() may be called as often as desired.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Note that LazyMap is not synchronized and is not thread-safe. If you wish to use this map from multiple threads concurrently, you must use appropriate synchronization. The simplest approach is to wrap this map using {@link java.util.Collections#synchronizedMap(Map)}.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Note that CaseInsensitiveMap is not synchronized and is not thread-safe. If you wish to use this map from multiple threads concurrently, you must use appropriate synchronization. The simplest approach is to wrap this map using {@link java.util.Collections#synchronizedMap(Map)}.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 In addition, this implementation allows the type of collection used for the values to be controlled. By default, an ArrayList is used, however a Class to instantiate may be specified, or a factory that returns a Collection instance.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The following extension interfaces exist:      {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.source.IVerticalRulerInfoExtension} since version 3.0 allowing custom annotation hovers and specific annotation models.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Programmers do not normally create ManagementPermission objects directly. Instead they are created by the security policy code based on reading the security policy file.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Note that the current contents of the MemoryHandler buffer are not written out. That requires a "push".	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSortedMap Collections.synchronizedSortedMap} method.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedList Collections.synchronizedList} method.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 When a very large ASCII value is input to a LONGVARCHAR parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a java.io.InputStream.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The required FontMetrics parameter may be created in the following way: GC gc = new GC(control); gc.setFont(control.getFont()); fontMetrics = gc.getFontMetrics(); gc.dispose();	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 @deprecated This type of security checking is not recommended. It is recommended that the checkPermission call be used instead.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 @deprecated This type of security checking is not recommended. It is recommended that the checkPermission call be used instead.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 This factory, whose parameter list uses the varargs feature, may be used to create an enum set initially containing an arbitrary number of elements, but it is likely to run slower than the overloadings that do not use varargs.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Note that there is another method for efficiently processing the simultaneous addition of multiple elements.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The following extension interfaces exist:      {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.ITextHoverExtension} since version 3.0 allowing a text hover to provide a creator for the hover control. This allows for sophisticated hovers in a way that information computed by the hover can be displayed in the best possible form.     {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.ITextHoverExtension2} since version 3.4 allowing a text hover to return hover-specific information objects.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If multiple threads access a map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value associated with an existing key is not a structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map. If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSortedMap Collections.synchronizedSortedMap} method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the map:     SortedMap m = Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new TreeMap(...));	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable to use method {@link #offerLast}.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable to use {@link #offerLast(Object) offerLast}.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 For a one time comparison, this method has the best performance. If a given String will be involved in multiple comparisons, CollationKey.compareTo has the best performance.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Note that this implementation is not synchronized.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Iterators must be manually synchronized.   synchronized (coll) {    Iterator it = coll.iterator();    // do stuff with iterator  }    @return an iterator that must be manually synchronized on the collection	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 This implementation is not synchronized. You can use {@link java.util.Collections#synchronizedMap} to provide synchronized access to a ReferenceIdentityMap. Remember that synchronization will not stop the garbage collecter removing entries.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 You must manually synchronize on the returned buffer's iterator to avoid non-deterministic behavior:   Collection c = CollectionUtils.synchronizedCollection(myCollection);  synchronized (c) {      Iterator i = c.iterator();      while (i.hasNext()) {          process (i.next());      }  }	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 You must manually synchronize on the returned buffer's iterator to avoid non-deterministic behavior:   Set s = SetUtils.synchronizedSet(mySet);  synchronized (s) {      Iterator i = s.iterator();      while (i.hasNext()) {          process (i.next());      }  }	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 All PolicyQualifierInfo objects must be immutable and thread-safe.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 All PolicyNode objects must be immutable and thread-safe.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective

Multiple threads that need to access a single object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Note that IdentityMap is not synchronized and is not thread-safe. If you wish to use this map from multiple threads concurrently, you must use appropriate synchronization.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If multiple threads access a linked hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it must be synchronized externally.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If multiple threads access an enum map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map, it should be synchronized externally.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 @param sortOrder new sort order. The comparator must be able to support being used in a background thread.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the default barging (also known as greedy, renouncement, and convoy-avoidance) strategy. While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed against incoming threads. Also, while acquires do not "spin" in the usual sense, they may perform multiple invocations of tryAcquire interspersed with other computations before blocking. This gives most of the benefits of spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with "fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking {@link #hasContended} and/or {@link #hasQueuedThreads} to only do so if the synchronizer is likely not to be contended.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 If your application needs to set a different security manager, you must ensure that the policy file specified by the group's ActivationGroupDesc grants the group the necessary permissions to set a new security manager	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Users should cast the generic URLConnection to a JarURLConnection when they know that the URL they created is a JAR URL, and they need JAR-specific functionality. For example:   URL url = new URL("jar:file:/home/duke/duke.jar!/");  JarURLConnection jarConnection = (JarURLConnection)url.openConnection();  Manifest manifest = jarConnection.getManifest();	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 @return the object fetched. The instanceof operator should be used to determine the specific kind of object returned.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 This constructor should only be used for serialization.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 The circumstances and the exception type must be documented by that { Lock} implementation	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 An application remotely accesses the platform MXBeans using proxy should prepare to catch IOException as if accessing with the MBeanServerConnector interface.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 This method may be called frequently, so implementors should ensure it returns quickly, e.g. by caching the returned creator.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together in this manner is more efficient (and convenient) than reading out the contents of each Iterator into a List and creating a new Iterator.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together in this manner is more efficient (and convenient) than using nested for loops to extract a list.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Typically, an exception will be thrown (such as {@link IllegalMonitorStateException}) and the implementation must document that fact.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 List classes should clearly specify in their documentation any restrictions on what elements may be added.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 An implementation should document when this is the case.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 In general WARNING messages should describe events that will be of interest to end users or system managers, or which indicate potential problems.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Therefore, if a logging Handler wants to pass off a LogRecord to another thread, or to transmit it over RMI, and if it wishes to subsequently obtain method name or class name information it should call one of getSourceClassName or getSourceMethodName to force the values to be filled in.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective
 Note: This method requires a full internal traversal of the hash table, and so is much slower than method containsKey.	__label__MiscellaneousDirective

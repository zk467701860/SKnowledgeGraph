FP: @param actions Must be either null or the empty string.
FP: If the value of the len parameter is negative then no characters are written. This is contrary to the specification of this method in the {@linkplain java.io.Writer#write(java.lang.String,int,int) superclass}, which requires that an {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException} be thrown.
FP: @param filterStyle a constant indicating how keystrokes received in the proposal popup affect filtering of the proposals shown. FILTER_NONE specifies that no automatic filtering of the content proposal list will occur as keys are typed in the popup. FILTER_CHARACTER specifies that the content of the popup will be filtered by the most recently typed character. FILTER_CUMULATIVE is deprecated and no longer recommended. It specifies that the content of the popup will be filtered by a string containing all the characters typed since the popup has been open.
FP: tive - Parameter: too vague): @param actions Must be either null or the empty string
FP: For a user-defined parameter, the fully-qualified SQL type name of the parameter should also be given, while a REF parameter requires that the fully-qualified type name of the referenced type be given.
FP: The key for any entry in such a map must be in one of the following two formats: * . The cryptographic service name must not contain any dots. The value associated with the key must be an empty string. A provider satisfies this selection criterion iff the provider implements the specified algorithm or type for the specified cryptographic service. * . The cryptographic service name must not contain any dots. There must be one or more space charaters between the and the . The value associated with the key must be a non-empty string. A provider satisfies this selection criterion iff the provider implements the specified algorithm or type for the specified cryptographic service and its implementation meets the constraint expressed by the specified attribute name/value pair.
FP: The name is provided in string format. RFC 822, DNS, and URI names use the well-established string formats for those types (subject to the restrictions included in RFC 2459). IPv4 address names are supplied using dotted quad notation. OID address names are represented as a series of nonnegative integers separated by periods. And directory names (distinguished names) are supplied in RFC 2253 format. No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names, EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names. They should be specified using the {@link #addPathToName(int type, byte [] name) addPathToName(int type, byte [] name)} method.
FP: For a user-named parameter the fully-qualified SQL type name of the parameter should also be given, while a REF parameter requires that the fully-qualified type name of the referenced type be given. A JDBC driver that does not need the type code and type name information may ignore it. To be portable, however, applications should always provide these values for user-named and REF parameters.

FN: The parseObject method in the various Format classes requires a ParsePosition object as an argument.
FN: One version of the format method in the various Format classes requires a FieldPosition object as an argument.
FN: @param collectionClass the type of collections to return from the map (must contain public no-arg constructor and extend Collection)
FN: For an option that has a notion of on and off, and requires a non-boolean parameter, setting its value to anything other than Boolean(false) implicitly enables it.
FN: Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an immediate ClassCastException.
FN: @throws ClassCastException if the specified key cannot be compared with the keys currently in the map
FP: All elements in the array must be mutually comparable by the specified comparator (that is, c.compare(e1, e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the array)
FP: Furthermore, all elements in the list must be mutually comparable (that is, e1.compareTo(e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the list).
FP: How many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a? There must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part, and beyond that as many, but only as many, more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type float.

Then f must be the float value nearest to x; or, if two float values are equally close to x, then f must be one of them and the least significant bit of the significand of f must be 0.
FP: How many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a? There must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part, and beyond that as many, but only as many, more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type double. That is, suppose that x is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument d. Then d must be the double value nearest to x; or if two double values are equally close to x, then d must be one of them and the least significant bit of the significand of d must be 0.
FP: @return a set of permissions granted to the specified ProtectionDomain. If this operation is supported, the returned set of permissions must be a new mutable instance and it must support heterogeneous Permission types
FP: @return a constant indicating how keystrokes in the proposal popup affect filtering of the proposals shown. FILTER_NONE specifies that no filtering will occur in the content proposal list as keys are typed. FILTER_CHARACTER specifies the content of the popup will be filtered by the most recently typed character. FILTER_CUMULATIVE is deprecated and no longer recommended.
FP: The PRECISION column represents the specified column size for the given parameter or column. For numeric data, this is the maximum precision. For character data, this is the length in characters. For datetime datatypes, this is the length in characters of the String representation (assuming the maximum allowed precision of the fractional seconds component). For binary data, this is the length in bytes. For the ROWID datatype, this is the length in bytes. Null is returned for data types where the column size is not applicable

For specification of all possible formatting errors, see the Details section of the formatter class specification. @throws FormatterClosedException If this formatter has been closed by invoking its {@link #close()} method
FP: @exception EOFException if this input stream reaches the end before reading all the bytes. @exception IOException the stream has been closed and the contained input stream does not support reading after close, or another I/O error occurs. @exception UTFDataFormatException if the bytes do not represent a valid modified UTF-8 encoding of a string.
FP: all such elements must be mutually comparable: { e1.compareTo(e2)} must not throw a { ClassCastException} for any elements { e1} and { e2} in the set
FP: all such elements must be mutually comparable: { e1.compareTo(e2)} must not throw a { ClassCastException} for any elements { e1} and { e2} in the set.
FP: All elements in the collection must implement the Comparable interface.
FP: There are several restrictions on the parameters that may be passed to Proxy.getProxyClass: * All of the Class objects in the interfaces array must represent interfaces, not classes or primitive types. * No two elements in the interfaces array may refer to identical Class objects. * All of the interface types must be visible by name through the specified class loader. In other words, for class loader cl and every interface i, the following expression must be true: Class.forName(i.getName(), false, cl) == i * All non-public interfaces must be in the same package; otherwise, it would not be possible for the proxy class to implement all of the interfaces, regardless of what package it is defined in. * For any set of member methods of the specified interfaces that have the same signature: o If the return type of any of the methods is a primitive type or void, then all of the methods must have that same return type. o Otherwise, one of the methods must have a return type that is assignable to all of the return types of the rest of the methods.
FP: Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an ArrayStoreException is thrown and the destination is not modified:      The src argument refers to an object that is not an array.     The dest argument refers to an object that is not an array.     The src argument and dest argument refer to arrays whose component types are different primitive types.     The src argument refers to an array with a primitive component type and the dest argument refers to an array with a reference component type.     The src argument refers to an array with a reference component type and the dest argument refers to an array with a primitive component type.   Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown and the destination is not modified:      The srcPos argument is negative.     The destPos argument is negative.     The length argument is negative.     srcPos+length is greater than src.length, the length of the source array.     destPos+length is greater than dest.length, the length of the destination array.   Because of the restrictions already itemized, this paragraph effectively applies only to the situation where both arrays have component types that are reference types.

FN: This call is not required if the entire paragraph fits on one line.
FN: To be portable, applications must give the SQL type code and the fully-qualified SQL type name when specifying a NULL user-defined or REF parameter. In the case of a user-defined type the name is the type name of the parameter itself.
FN: In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates, the certificate provided in inStream must be DER-encoded and may be supplied in binary or printable (Base64) encoding. If the certificate is provided in Base64 encoding, it must be bounded at the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and must be bounded at the end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----.

Invoking any of the write methods of the resulting object will cause an {@link java.io.IOException} to be thrown.     "rw"  Open for reading and writing. If the file does not already exist then an attempt will be made to create it.     "rws"  Open for reading and writing, as with "rw", and also require that every update to the file's content or metadata be written synchronously to the underlying storage device.     "rwd"    Open for reading and writing, as with "rw", and also require that every update to the file's content be written synchronously to the underlying storage device.
FN: HTTP requires all request properties which can legally have multiple instances with the same key to use a comma-seperated list syntax which enables multiple properties to be appended into a single property.
FN: If the system property java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer is defined, then the value is taken to be the fully-qualified name of a concrete implementation class, which must implement Packer.
FN: The family should have a default resource bundle which simply has the same name as its family - "MyResources" - and will be used as the bundle of last resort if a specific locale is not supported.
FN: The range may no only contain complete partitions but starts at the beginning of a line in the middle of a partition of the given content type. This requires that a partition delimiter can not contain a line delimiter.
FN: The recommended encoding scheme to use is UTF-8. However, for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is not specified, then the default encoding of the platform is used.
FN: @param nameConstraints a byte array containing the ASN.1 DER encoding of a NameConstraints extension to be used for checking name constraints. Only the value of the extension is included, not the OID or criticality flag.
FN: This class also accepts dangling brackets but is strict about dangling metacharacters like +, ? and *, and will throw a {@link PatternSyntaxException} if it encounters them.
FN: A character may start a Java identifier if and only if one of the following conditions is true:      {@link #isLetter(char) isLetter(ch)} returns true     {@link #getType(char) getType(ch)} returns LETTER_NUMBER     ch is a currency symbol (such as "$")     ch is a connecting punctuation character (such as "_").
FN: This method can handle both label and entire domain name, by assuming that labels in a domain name are always separated by dots.
FN: It is assumed that all characters in the encoded string are one of the following: "a" through "z", "A" through "Z", "0" through "9", and "-", "_", ".", and "*". The character "%" is allowed but is interpreted as the start of a special escaped sequence.
FN: Whether aliases are case sensitive is implementation dependent. In order to avoid problems, it is recommended not to use aliases in a KeyStore that only differ in case.
FN: A URL can optionally specify a "port", which is the port number to which the TCP connection is made on the remote host machine. If the port is not specified, the default port for the protocol is used instead. For example, the default port for http is 80. An alternative port could be specified as:           http://www.socs.uts.edu.au:80/MosaicDocs-old/url-primer.html

For specification of all possible formatting errors, see the Details section of the formatter class specification.
FN: With lenient interpretation, a date such as "February 942, 1996" will be treated as being equivalent to the 941st day after February 1, 1996. With strict (non-lenient) interpretation, such dates will cause an exception to be thrown.
FN: @param encodedKey the key, which is assumed to be encoded according to the PKCS #8 standard.
FP: The first element of each pair is the key, which must be a String, and the second element is the value associated with that key.
FP: The createGroup method has two requirements on the group to be created: 1) the group must be a concrete subclass of ActivationGroup, and 2) the group must have a constructor that takes two arguments:      the group's ActivationGroupID, and     the group's initialization data (in a java.rmi.MarshalledObject)
FP: The characters in the string must all be digits of the specified radix (as determined by whether {@link java.lang.Character#digit(char, int)} returns a nonnegative value), except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign '-' ('\u002D') to indicate a negative value.
FP: The final index of the range (to), which must be greater than or equal to from, may be greater than original.length, in which case '\\u000' is placed in all elements of the copy whose index is greater than or equal to original.length - from.
FP: A SubformatPattern must be a valid pattern string for the Format subclass used.
FP: If name is not null, it must be equal to the binary name of the class specified by the byte array "b", otherwise a {@link NoClassDefFoundError} will be thrown.

FN: A MessageDigest object starts out initialized. The data is processed through it using the {@link #update(byte) update} methods. At any point {@link #reset() reset} can be called to reset the digest. Once all the data to be updated has been updated, one of the {@link #digest() digest} methods should be called to complete the hash computation.
FN: The "last used" Iterator is the Iterator upon which next() or hasNext() was most recently called used for the remove() operation only
FN: This method may only be called once, otherwise an IllegalStateException will occur.

FN: Note: {@link ListIterator} implementations that support add() and remove() only allow set() to be called once per call to next() or previous (see the {@link ListIterator} javadoc for more details).
FN: This means that you don't have to wrap instances of this class with {@link java.util.Collections#synchronizedMap(Map)}; instances are already thread-safe.
FN: Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged security context.
FN: Thus level settings for child nodes in the tree should come after settings for their parents.
FN: Purges stale mappings from this map before read operations.

FN: If the same listener instance has been added to the listener table through multiple invocations of addPropertyChangeListener, then an equivalent number of removePropertyChangeListener invocations are required to remove all instances of that listener from the listener table.
FN: When the data is later uncompressed with Inflater.inflate(), Inflater.getAdler() can be called in order to get the Adler-32 value of the dictionary required for decompression.

FN: Constructs a new EnumerationIterator that will not function until {@link #setEnumeration(Enumeration)} is called.
FN: Events are not generated when preferences are modified in descendants of this node; a caller desiring such events must register with each descendant.
FN: If the matcher is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be reset.
FN: When waiting upon a { Condition}, a "spurious wakeup" is permitted to occur, in general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics. This has little practical impact on most application programs as a { Condition} should always be waited upon in a loop, testing the state predicate that is being waited for.
FN: If the matcher is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be reset.
FN: This method may be called repeatedly to iterate through the list backwards, or intermixed with calls to next to go back and forth. (Note that alternating calls to next and previous will return the same element repeatedly.)
FN: As of 3.2, AbstractTreeViewer supports multiple equal elements (each with a different parent chain) in the tree. This support requires that clients enable the element map by calling setUseHashLookup(true).
FN: As the ILazyContentProvider does not have API for determining the total item count any changes to the number of items for this object while require a call to #setItemCount on the viewer that uses it.
FN: The recommended usage is to use {@link java.net.URI} to identify resources, then convert it into a {@link java.net.URL} when it is time to access the resource. From that URL, you can either get the {@link java.net.URLConnection} for fine control, or get directly the InputStream.  Here is an example:  URI uri = new URI("http://java.sun.com/"); URL url = uri.toURL(); InputStream in = url.openStream();
FN: Since the time when GC would invoke this method is undetermined, it is strongly recommended that applications invoke the close method as soon they have finished accessing this ZipFile.
FN: It is strongly recommended that an application explicitly commits or rolls back an active transaction prior to calling the close method.
FN: Note that the default implementation of this method does not call setRedraw.
FN: Note that the dialog will have no visual representation (no widgets) until it is told to open.
FN: Note: the node is not visually expanded! You may have to call parent.setExpanded(true).
FN: Note that the window will have no visual representation (no widgets) until it is told to open.
FN: Note that the dialog will have no visual representation (no widgets) until it is told to open.
FN: This can be used prior to a sequence of additions to avoid memory reallocation.
FN: Prior to disposing, a painter should be deactivated.
FN: Assumes that the element has been expanded before.
FN: The output stream can be used again, reusing the already allocated buffer space.
FN: This signature object is reset to its initial state (the state it was in after a call to one of the initSign methods) and can be reused to generate further signatures with the same private key.
FN: Returns the SWT menu, created as a pop up menu parented by the given control. In most cases, this menu can be created once, cached and reused when the pop-up/drop-down action occurs. If the menu must be dynamically created (i.e., each time it is popped up or dropped down), the old menu should be disposed of before replacing it with the new menu.
FN: If the font of the specified control is changed after this PixelConverter is created, then the conversions from this instance will not produce the desired effect.
FN: This method takes the Device that created the Image as an argument, allowing the original Image to be reused if the descriptor is asked for another Image on the same device.
FN: Returns an SWT menu created as a drop down menu parented by the given menu. In most cases, this menu can be created once, cached and reused when the pop-up/drop-down action occurs.
FN: Note that all preference nodes must be dispose their resources. The node must dispose the page managed by this node, and any SWT resources allocated by this node (Images, Fonts, etc). However the node itself may be reused.
FN: Previous values of other fields are retained. If this is not desired, call {@link #clear()} first.
FN: When the caller is done with an image obtained from createResource, they must call destroyResource() rather than disposing the Image directly. The result of createResource() can be safely cast to an Image.
FN: Note that depending on the values the human has supplied so far, additional values may become necessary, so it may be necessary to iterate though several calls to the getPropertyInfo method.
FN: This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result.
FN: Painters are informed about changes to the viewer content and state and can take the necessary action in responds to the notification.
FN: If the resource is intended to live for entire lifetime of the resource manager, a subsequent call to {@link #destroy(DeviceResourceDescriptor)} may be omitted and the resource will be cleaned up when the resource manager is disposed. This pattern is useful for short-lived {@link LocalResourceManager}s, but should never be used with the global resource manager since doing so effectively leaks the resource.
FN: Once this method returns successfully, it is safe to assume that all changes made in the subtree rooted at this node prior to the method invocation have become permanent.
FN: Adjust the bounds of the popup as necessary prior to opening the dialog.
FN: If fork is set to false, the runnable will run in the UI thread and it is the runnable's responsibility to call Display.readAndDispatch() to ensure UI responsiveness.
FN: The preference node assumes (sole) responsibility for disposing of the image; this will happen when the node is disposed.
FN: If this rules relies on a text pattern comprising a opening and a closing character sequence this method can also be called when the scanner is positioned already between the opening and the closing sequence. In this case, resume must be set to true.
FN: The object is invalid once the free method is called.
FN: Once the stream has been closed, further read(), ready(), mark(), or reset() invocations will throw an IOException
FN: This method can only be called once the connection has been completely verified by reading from the input stream until the end of the stream has been reached.
FN: Once a socket has been closed, it is not available for further networking use (i.e. can't be reconnected or rebound). A new socket needs to be created.
FN: Once the stream has been closed, further write() or flush() invocations will cause an IOException to be thrown.
FN: Once this method is called, the behavior of the Deflater object is undefined.
FN: lients should typically call this method once, create a color from the RGB provided, and dispose of the color when finished using it.
FN: Clients who created this column are responsible to call this method once the column is no longer used.
FN: Note: This method must be called at most once per reconcile step.
FN: Once the client is done with a wizard node, its disposemethod must be called to free up the wizard; once disposes, the node should no longer be used.
FN: Unlike {@link ISourceViewer#configure(SourceViewerConfiguration)} this method can be called more than once without interleaving calls to {@link ISourceViewer#configure(SourceViewerConfiguration)}.
FN: It should be set when the action is created. It should not be modified once the action is part of an action contribution item.
FN: Once established, a page's wizard cannot be changed to a different wizard.
FN: Note: It is the callers responsibility to prevent an endless loop i.e. to test whether a given anchor has already been used once.
FN: @throws IllegalStateException if this method is called more than once
FN: If no TableColumns were created by the programmer, this method will throw ERROR_INVALID_RANGE despite the fact that a single column of data may be visible in the table.
FN: May only be called from a UI thread.
FN: Invoking the method before the content area has been set or after the dialog has been disposed will have no effect.
FN: Invoking this method after this socket has been bound will have no effect.
FN: In this case, these tasks will only terminate upon shutdownNow, or after setting the policy to false when already shutdown.
FN: @param value if true, execute after shutdown, else don't. @see #getExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy
FN: Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned node and its ancestors if they do not already exist. If the returned node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until the flush method is called on the returned node (or one of its ancestors or descendants).
FN: If the returned node did not exist prior to this call, this node and any ancestors that were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until the flush method is called on the returned node (or one of its ancestors or descendants).
FN: It can be called at most once by an application.
FN: Reading and writing XML values to or from an SQLXML object can happen at most once. The conceptual states of readable and not readable determine if one of the reading APIs will return a value or throw an exception. The conceptual states of writable and not writable determine if one of the writing APIs will set a value or throw an exception.  The state moves from readable to not readable once free() or any of the reading APIs are called: getBinaryStream(), getCharacterStream(), getSource(), and getString(). Implementations may also change the state to not writable when this occurs.  The state moves from writable to not writeable once free() or any of the writing APIs are called: setBinaryStream(), setCharacterStream(), setResult(), and setString(). Implementations may also change the state to not readable when this occurs.
FN: Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by invoking the {@link #halt halt} method, which forcibly terminates the virtual machine.  Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a new shutdown hook or de-register a previously-registered hook. Attempting either of these operations will cause an {@link IllegalStateException} to be thrown.
FN: Once a node has been removed, attempting any method other than {@link #name()}, {@link #absolutePath()}, {@link #isUserNode()}, {@link #flush()} or {@link #node(String) nodeExists("")} on the corresponding Preferences instance will fail with an IllegalStateException
FN: @throws FormatterClosedException If this formatter has been closed by invoking its {@link #close()} method
FP: However, a call to set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 30) before the call to getTime() sets the date to September 30, 1999, since no recomputation occurs after set() itself.
FP: After invoking this method the file or directory is guaranteed not to change until it is either deleted or marked to allow write access.

FN: Implementors must either use the dialog font or override {@link #computeSizeConstraints(int, int)}.
FN: Subclasses should override this method rather than {@link #focusCellChanged(ViewerCell)}
FN: . The modifiers consist of the Java Virtual Machine's constants for public, protected, private, final, static, abstract and interface; they should be decoded using the methods of class Modifier.

FN: In general, {@link java.lang.String#toUpperCase()} should be used to map characters to uppercase.
FN: Where the existing class file bytes are to be transformed (for example in bytecode instrumentation) {@link #retransformClasses retransformClasses} should be used.
FN: . The StringBuilder class should generally be used in preference to this one, as it supports all of the same operations but it is faster, as it performs no synchronization.
FN: Sometimes a security check that should be made within a given context will actually need to be done from within a different context (for example, from within a worker thread). The {@link SecurityManager#getSecurityContext getSecurityContext} method and the {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission(java.security.Permission, java.lang.Object) checkPermission} method that includes a context argument are provided for this situation.

FN: Completion proposals can implement {@link ICompletionProposalExtension6} to provide colored proposal labels.
FN: By default, clients use ContentFormatter or MultiPassContentFormatter as the standard implementers of this interface.
FN: Also note that the equivalent of {@link #ListenerList()} is actually {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.ListenerList#ListenerList(int)} with {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.ListenerList#IDENTITY} as the argument.
FN: Content providers for tree viewers must implement either the {@link ITreeContentProvider} interface, (as of 3.2) the {@link ILazyTreeContentProvider} interface, or (as of 3.3) the {@link ILazyTreePathContentProvider}.

FN: The {@link org.apache.commons.collections.set.ListOrderedSet ListOrderedSet} class provides an alternative approach, by wrapping an existing Set and retaining insertion order in the iterator.
FN: An alternative to this method is to use the better named {@link #keyList()} or {@link #keySet()}.

FN: An alternative to this method is to use {@link #keySet()}.
FN: This method is an alternative to the {@link java.util.Map#putAll(java.util.Map)} method and constructors. It allows you to build a map from an object array of various possible styles.
FN: This map is designed for performance and can outstrip HashMap. It also has good garbage collection characteristics.      * Optimised for operation at size 3 or less.     * Still works well once size 3 exceeded.     * Gets at size 3 or less are about 0-10% faster than HashMap,     * Puts at size 3 or less are over 4 times faster than HashMap.     * Performance 5% slower than HashMap once size 3 exceeded once.

FN: slow
FN: This list implementation utilises a tree structure internally to ensure that all insertions and removals are O(log n). This provides much faster performance than both an ArrayList and a LinkedList where elements are inserted and removed repeatedly from anywhere in the list.
FN: ArrayList is a good general purpose list implementation. It is faster than TreeList for most operations except inserting and removing in the middle of the list. ArrayList also uses less memory as TreeList uses one object per entry.
FN: Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together in this manner is more efficient (and convenient) than reading out the contents of each Iterator into a List and creating a new Iterator.
FN: Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together in this manner is more efficient (and convenient) than using nested for loops to extract a list.

FN: Under many circumstances, linking Iterators together in this manner is more efficient (and convenient) than using nested for loops to extract a list.
FN: Because a Locale object is just an identifier for a region, no validity check is performed when you construct a Locale. If you want to see whether particular resources are available for the Locale you construct, you must query those resources.
FN: The following can be used to provide synchronized access to your BoundedFifoBuffer:     Buffer fifo = BufferUtils.synchronizedBuffer(new BoundedFifoBuffer());
FN: The following can be used to provide synchronized access to your CircularFifoBuffer:     Buffer fifo = BufferUtils.synchronizedBuffer(new CircularFifoBuffer());
FN: Note that this method can be used to circumvent the map's value type at runtime.
FN: Note that IdentityMap and ReferenceIdentityMap are unsuitable for use as the key comparison would work on the whole MultiKey, not the elements within.

FN: In previous versions of this class, it was mandatory to close all cursor objects to avoid memory leaks. It is no longer necessary to call this close method; an instance of this class can now be treated exactly like a normal iterator.
FN: If you subclass AbstractLinkedMap but not LinkEntry then you will not be able to access the protected fields. The entryXxx() methods on AbstractLinkedMap exist to provide the necessary access.
FN: If you subclass AbstractHashedMap but not HashEntry then you will not be able to access the protected fields. The entryXxx() methods on AbstractHashedMap exist to provide the necessary access.
FN: In addition, this implementation allows the type of collection used for the values to be controlled. By default, an ArrayList is used, however a Class to instantiate may be specified, or a factory that returns a Collection instance.
FN: Although this can be used to reset iteration, the {@link #reset()} method is a more effective choice.
FN: If the last value for a key is removed, implementations typically return null from a subsequant get(Object), however they may choose to return an empty collection.
FN: Implementations typically return null if no values have been mapped to the key, however the implementation may choose to return an empty collection.

FN: @return the Collection of values removed, implementations should return null for no mapping found, but may return an empty collection
FN: For random access data (such as an array), AbstractList should be used in preference to this class.
FN: Like most collection implementations, EnumSet is not synchronized. If multiple threads access an enum set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the enum set. If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSet} method.
FN: If multiple threads access a tree set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the set. If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSortedSet Collections.synchronizedSortedSet} method.
FN: Note: This class should only be used if you need to add bounded behaviour to another buffer. If you just want a bounded buffer then you should use {@link BoundedFifoBuffer} or {@link CircularFifoBuffer}

FN: Instances of StringBuilder are not safe for use by multiple threads. If such synchronization is required then it is recommended that {@link java.lang.StringBuffer} be used.
FN: If the object has a custom mapping (is of a class implementing the interface SQLData), the JDBC driver should call the method SQLData.writeSQL to write it to the SQL data stream. If, on the other hand, the object is of a class implementing Ref, Blob, Clob, NClob, Struct, java.net.URL, or Array, the driver should pass it to the database as a value of the corresponding SQL type.

FN: Note that the current contents of the MemoryHandler buffer are not written out. That requires a "push".
FN: Like the {@link #matches matches} method, this method always starts at the beginning of the region; unlike that method, it does not require that the entire region be matched.
FN: Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters.
FN: If a lookup of the name service is required, call {@link #getCanonicalHostName() getCanonicalHostName}.
FN: Standard implementations of common closures are provided by {@link ClosureUtils}. These include method invokation and for/while loops.
FN: Standard implementations of common predicates are provided by {@link PredicateUtils}. These include true, false, instanceof, equals, and, or, not, method invokation and null testing.

FN: If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedList Collections.synchronizedList} method.
FN: Events are not generated when indirect descendants of this node are added or removed; a caller desiring such events must register with each descendant.
FN: If you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even if users forget to call {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#shutdown}, then you must arrange that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or setting {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)}.
FN: If {@link ICompletionProposalExtension5} is implemented, this method should not be called any longer.
FN: In case the client does not explicitly initialize the AlgorithmParameterGenerator (via a call to an engineInit method), each provider must supply (and document) a default initialization.

FN: In case the client does not explicitly initialize the KeyPairGenerator (via a call to an initialize method), each provider must supply (and document) a default initialization.
FN: Images allocated in this manner must be disposed by {@link #destroyImage(ImageDescriptor)}, and never by calling {@link Image#dispose()}.
FN: Any color allocated in this manner must be disposed by calling {@link #destroyColor(RGB)}, or by an eventual call to {@link #dispose()}. {@link Color#dispose()} must never been called directly on the returned color.
FN: When a very large ASCII value is input to a LONGVARCHAR parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a java.io.InputStream.
FN: Clients should handle labelProviderChangedEvents for the given element to get the complete decoration.
FN: Add operations require the use of a pluggable strategy. If no strategy is provided then add is unsupported.
FN: Add and remove operations require the use of a pluggable strategy. If no strategy is provided then add and remove are unsupported.
FN: These formatting strategies are required to handle the position updating of the document. To facilitate the work with these text edit based formatting strategies, a default implementation called ContextBasedFormattingStrategy is provided.
FN: This method should no longer be used for actions in the Eclipse workbench. IWorkbenchCommandSupport and IWorkbenchContextSupport provide all the functionality required for key bindings.

FN: The required FontMetrics parameter may be created in the following way: GC gc = new GC(control); gc.setFont(control.getFont()); fontMetrics = gc.getFontMetrics(); gc.dispose();
FN: Specifying which properties are affected may allow the viewer to optimize the update. For example, if the label provider is not affected by changes to any of these properties, an update may not actually be required.
FN: The default is false for backwards compatibility, but the recommended practice is to specify true, and specify the desired width for the content of the column, rather than adding a fudge factor to the specified width.
FN: This is not recommended and is included for backwards compatability. It is recommended to use the default font provided by SWT (that is, do not set the font).
FN: If the caller adds its own columns, uses Table.setHeadersVisible(true), or needs to handle dynamic resizing of the table, it is recommended to create the Table itself, specifying the SWT.CHECK style bit (along with any other style bits needed), and use new CheckboxTableViewer(Table) rather than this constructor.
FN: The results of this constructor can be somewhat unpredictable and its use is generally not recommended; see the notes under the {@link #BigDecimal(double)} constructor.
FN: It is recommended that the {@link #probablePrime probablePrime} method be used in preference to this constructor unless there is a compelling need to specify a certainty.
FN: Overloadings of this method exist to initialize an enum set with one through five elements. A sixth overloading is provided that uses the varargs feature. This overloading may be used to create an enum set initially containing an arbitrary number of elements, but is likely to run slower than the overloadings that do not use varargs.

FN: Subclasses of ClassLoader are encouraged to override {@link #findClass(String)}, rather than this method.
FN: Typically you shouldn't use DateFormatSymbols directly. Rather, you are encouraged to create a date-time formatter with the DateFormat class's factory methods: getTimeInstance, getDateInstance, or getDateTimeInstance.

FN: Note that there is another method for efficiently processing the simultaneous removal of multiple elements.
FN: Note that there is another method for efficiently processing the simultaneous addition of multiple elements.
FN: This {@literal "static factory method"} is provided in preference to a ({ long}, { int}) constructor because it allows for reuse of frequently used { BigDecimal} values.
FN: The three forms of { park} each also support a { blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker}.) The use of these forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a { blocker} within a lock implementation is { this}.
FN: SimpleDateFormat allows you to start by choosing any user-defined patterns for date-time formatting. However, you are encouraged to create a date-time formatter with either getTimeInstance, getDateInstance, or getDateTimeInstance in DateFormat.
FN: If only the given element needs updating, it is more efficient to use the update methods.
FN: . Note that there is another method for efficiently processing the simultaneous removal of multiple elements.
FN: The statement       boolean b = Pattern.matches("a*b", "aaaaab");  is equivalent to the three statements above, though for repeated matches it is less efficient since it does not allow the compiled pattern to be reused.
FN: The default Policy implementation can be changed by setting the value of the "policy.provider" security property (in the Java security properties file) to the fully qualified name of the desired Policy subclass implementation.
FN: The style bit SWT.WRAP should be used if a larger message area is desired.

FN: Since 3.3, an alternative API is available, see {@link ViewerColumn#setEditingSupport(EditingSupport)} for a more flexible way of editing values in a column viewer.
FN: Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create "anonymous" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace.

FN: Dialog does not use the following images in the registry DLG_IMG_ERROR DLG_IMG_INFO DLG_IMG_QUESTION DLG_IMG_WARNING They are now coming directly from SWT, see ImageRegistry. For backwards compatibility they are still supported, however new code should use SWT for these.
FN: The following extension interfaces exist:      {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.source.IAnnotationAccessExtension} since version 3.0 replacing all methods in that interface     {@link IAnnotationAccessExtension2} since version 3.2 allowing to set a quick assist assistant to an annotation access.
FN: You do not have to restrict yourself to using a single family of ResourceBundles. For example, you could have a set of bundles for exception messages, ExceptionResources (ExceptionResources_fr, ExceptionResources_de, ...), and one for widgets, WidgetResource (WidgetResources_fr, WidgetResources_de, ...); breaking up the resources however you like.
FN: When possible, this method checks for write permissions and other operating system restrictions and will therefore usually provide a more accurate estimate of how much new data can actually be written than {@link #getFreeSpace}.
FN: The following extension interfaces exist:      {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.source.IAnnotationHoverExtension} since version 3.0 allowing a text hover to provide a creator for the hover control.

FN: CollationKeys provide better performance than Collator.compare when Strings are involved in multiple comparisons.
FN: Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often changes during localization, it is generally better to use the {@link #setFormatByArgumentIndex setFormatByArgumentIndex} method, which accesses format elements based on the argument index they specify.
FN: For comparing Strings exactly once, the compare method provides the best performance. When sorting a list of Strings however, it is generally necessary to compare each String multiple times. In this case, CollationKeys provide better performance.
FN: Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often changes during localization, it is generally better to use the {@link #setFormatsByArgumentIndex setFormatsByArgumentIndex} method, which assumes an order of formats corresponding to the order of elements in the arguments array passed to the format methods or the result array returned by the parse methods.
FN: Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often changes during localization, it's generally better to use the {@link #getFormatsByArgumentIndex getFormatsByArgumentIndex} method, which assumes an order of formats corresponding to the order of elements in the arguments array passed to the format methods or the result array returned by the parse methods.
FN: Note that this method does not clean up references between this tool bar manager and its associated contribution items. Use removeAll for that purpose.
FN: Note that this method does not clean up references between this cool bar manager and its associated contribution items. Use removeAll for that purpose.
FN: Note that this method does not clean up references between this menu manager and its associated contribution items. Use removeAll for that purpose.
FN: It should be set once either in the constructor or using this method.
FN: If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the set. If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSet Collections.synchronizedSet} method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the set:     Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));
FN: If multiple threads access a linked hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the set. If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSet Collections.synchronizedSet} method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the set:     Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new LinkedHashSet(...));
FN: If multiple threads access an identity hash map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value associated with a key that an instance already contains is not a structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map. If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap} method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the map:     Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new IdentityHashMap(...));
FN: If multiple threads access a map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value associated with an existing key is not a structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map. If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the {@link Collections#synchronizedSortedMap Collections.synchronizedSortedMap} method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the map:     SortedMap m = Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new TreeMap(...));
FN: For these reasons, environment variables are more likely to have unintended side effects. It is best to use system properties where possible.
FN: If the backing store naturally flushes an entire subtree at once, the implementer is encouraged to override flush(), rather than merely overriding this method.
FN: If the backing store naturally syncs an entire subtree at once, the implementer is encouraged to override sync(), rather than merely overriding this method.
FN: For efficiency, a character-stream object may use an object other than itself to protect critical sections.
FN: For efficiency, a character-stream object may use an object other than itself to protect critical sections.
FN: Note that this method does not clean up references between this status line manager and its associated contribution items. Use removeAll for that purpose.
FN: Note that the preferred way of re-initializing a preference to its default value is to call setToDefault.
FN: Note that the static convenience method getImage is also provided on this class.
FN: Note that there is another method for efficiently processing the simultaneous addition of multiple elements.
FN: If only the given element needs updating, it is more efficient to use the update methods.
FN: If the old behavior is desired by subclasses, get the returned composite's layout data and set grabExcessVerticalSpace to true.
FN: The default CertPathBuilder type can be changed by setting the value of the "certpathbuilder.type" security property (in the Java security properties file) to the desired type.
FN: Once a remote object is registered (bound) with the RMI registry on the local host, callers on a remote (or local) host can lookup the remote object by name, obtain its reference, and then invoke remote methods on the object. A registry may be shared by all servers running on a host or an individual server process may create and use its own registry if desired (see java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry.createRegistry method for details).
FN: The default CertPathValidator type can be changed by setting the value of the "certpathvalidator.type" security property (in the Java security properties file) to the desired type.
FN: Since 3.3, an alternative API is available, see {@link ViewerColumn#setEditingSupport(EditingSupport)} for a more flexible way of editing values in a column viewer.
FN: This class is intended as an alternative to the JFace ListViewer, which displays its content in a combo box rather than a list.
FN: May fail spuriously and does not provide ordering guarantees, so is only rarely an appropriate alternative to { compareAndSet}.
FN: May fail spuriously and does not provide ordering guarantees, so is only rarely an appropriate alternative to { compareAndSet}.
FN: May fail spuriously and does not provide ordering guarantees, so is only rarely an appropriate alternative to { compareAndSet}.
FN: By default it looks in sun.net.www.content, but users can define a vertical-bar delimited set of class prefixes to search through in addition by defining the java.content.handler.pkgs property.
FN: If the default behavior is not desired, then a Java security property can be set to a different Time-to-live (TTL) value for positive caching.
FN: These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves useful for most concurrency control applications.
FN: This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result.
FN: Because databases may use an optimized representation for the XML, accessing the value through getSource() and setResult() can lead to improved processing performance without serializing to a stream representation and parsing the XML.
FN: This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access:   Set<MyEnum> s = Collections.synchronizedSet(EnumSet.noneOf(MyEnum.class));
FN: For a one time comparison, this method has the best performance. If a given String will be involved in multiple comparisons, CollationKey.compareTo has the best performance.
FN: Note that if both the integer quotient and remainder are needed, this method is faster than using the { divideToIntegralValue} and { remainder} methods separately because the division need only be carried out once.
FN: Note that there is a significant difference between writing a String into the stream as primitive data or as an Object.
FP: When threads must repeatedly count down in this way, instead use a {@link CyclicBarrier}.
FP: Classes that need to designate a replacement when an instance of it is read from the stream should implement this special method with the exact signature.   ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException;
FP: Serializable classes that need to designate an alternative object to be used when writing an object to the stream should implement this special method with the exact signature:   ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object writeReplace() throws ObjectStreamException;
FP: Not all databases allow for a non-typed Null to be sent to the backend. For maximum portability, the setNull or the setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x, int sqlType) method should be used instead of setObject(int parameterIndex, Object x).
FP: Not all databases allow for a non-typed Null to be sent to the backend. For maximum portability, the setNull or the setObject(String parameterName, Object x, int sqlType) method should be used instead of setObject(String parameterName, Object x).

FN: The cursor enables iteration and list changes to occur in any order without invalidating the iterator (from one thread).
FN: Each bucket in the hash table has its own monitor, so two threads can safely operate on the map at the same time, often without incurring any monitor contention.
FN: It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use { Lock} instances in this way, except within their own implementation.
FN: @return a negative value on failure; zero if acquisition in shared mode succeeded but no subsequent shared-mode acquire can succeed; and a positive value if acquisition in shared mode succeeded and subsequent shared-mode acquires might also succeed, in which case a subsequent waiting thread must check availability.
FN: @return a negative value on failure; zero if acquisition in shared mode succeeded but no subsequent shared-mode acquire can succeed; and a positive value if acquisition in shared mode succeeded and subsequent shared-mode acquires might also succeed, in which case a subsequent waiting thread must check availability.
FN: In either case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.
FN: Before waiting on the condition the lock must be held by the current thread.
FN: DEADLOCK WARNING: Calling this method may call undoableEditHappened in all listeners. It is unwise to call this method from one of its listeners.
FN: If the Collection will be modified by one thread while another thread is calling a method of a Collection CertStore that has been initialized with this Collection, the Collection must have fail-fast iterators.
FN: Threads that need to access a single CertPathValidatorSpi instance concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking before calling the wrapping CertPathValidator object.
FN: Instances of this class need not be protected against concurrent access from multiple threads. Threads that need to access a single CertPathBuilderSpi instance concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking before calling the wrapping CertPathBuilder object.
FN: Unless otherwise documented by a specific provider, threads that need to access a single CertPathValidator instance concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating a different CertPathValidator instance need not synchronize.
FN: Unless otherwise documented by a specific provider, threads that need to access a single CertPathBuilder instance concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating a different CertPathBuilder instance need not synchronize.
FN: Returns an iterator that does not support concurrent modification.  If the underlying list is modified while iterating using this iterator a ConcurrentModificationException will occur.
FN: An extended ListIterator that allows concurrent changes to the underlying list.
FN: Concurrent modifications are not directly supported, and for most collection implementations will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
FN: Concurrent modifications are not directly supported, and for most collection implementations will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
FN: The iterators returned by the collection views of this class are not fail-fast. They will never raise a {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException}.
FN: Note that this method should not synchronize the preferences in any subnodes of this node.
FN: This operation is not atomic and may have undesired effects.
FN: A multi-threaded application should either allocate multiple packer engines, or else serialize use of one engine with a lock.
FN: A multi-threaded application should either allocate multiple unpacker engines, or else serialize use of one engine with a lock.
FN: You must manually synchronize on the returned buffer's iterator to avoid non-deterministic behavior:
FN: Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from accessing a resource.
FN: Appendables are not necessarily safe for multithreaded access. Thread safety is the responsibility of classes that extend and implement this interface.
FN: Note that passing in an invalid id results in unspecified behavior.
FN: An implementation is required to clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the waiting methods, and when an implementation does support interruption of thread suspension then it must obey the interruption semantics as defined in this interface.
FN: In either case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.
FN: The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will likely vary from one JRE implementation to another. In light of this variation, careful tuning of the stack size parameter may be required, and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on which an application is to run.
FN: @param map the map to transform, must not be null, typically empty
FN: When locking and unlocking occur in different scopes, care must be taken to ensure that all code that is executed while the lock is held is protected by try-finally or try-catch to ensure that the lock is released when necessary.
FN: Due to the multi-threaded nature of class loading, it is possible for a transformer to receive calls after it has been removed. Transformers should be written defensively to expect this situation.
FN: When threads must repeatedly count down in this way, instead use a {@link CyclicBarrier}.
FN: This method should query if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the exclusive mode, and if so to acquire it.
FN: All { Lock} implementations must enforce the same memory synchronization semantics as provided by the built-in monitor lock, as described in The Java Language Specification, Third Edition (17.4 Memory Model)
FN: @param sortOrder new sort order. The comparator must be able to support being used in a background thread.
FN: This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result. Failure to do this may result in an {@link SWTException} being thrown.
FN: Likewise any application that updates an IPreferenceStore from a Thread other than the UI Thread should be aware of any listeners that require an update in the UI Thread.
FN: It is recommended practice to always immediately follow a call to { lock} with a { try} block, most typically in a before/after construction
FN: ttempting to use both objects from a single thread is not recommended as it may deadlock the thread.
FN: This method may be called on a non-UI thread.
FN: The ability to interrupt a lock acquisition in some implementations may not be possible, and if possible may be an expensive operation. The programmer should be aware that this may be the case.
FN: This may be executed on any thread.
FN: This method should only be called from the UI thread. If you are not on the UI thread then wrap the call with a PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay().synchExec() in order to guarantee the correct result.
FN: It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use { Condition} instances in this way, except perhaps within their own implementation.
FN: Attempting to use both objects from a single thread is not recommended, as it may deadlock the thread.
FN: Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during execution of this method, in which case the returned result will be inaccurate.
FN: If this write lock is not held when any {@link Condition} method is called then an {@link IllegalMonitorStateException} is thrown. (Read locks are held independently of write locks, so are not checked or affected. However it is essentially always an error to invoke a condition waiting method when the current thread has also acquired read locks, since other threads that could unblock it will not be able to acquire the write lock.)
FN: Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a { ConcurrentMap} as a key or value happen-before actions subsequent to the access or removal of that object from the { ConcurrentMap} in another thread.
FN: Furthermore, Enumerations returned via the elements method are not fail-fast. Modifications to a collection should not be performed while enumerating over that collection.
FN: Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the default barging (also known as greedy, renouncement, and convoy-avoidance) strategy. While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed against incoming threads. Also, while acquires do not "spin" in the usual sense, they may perform multiple invocations of tryAcquire interspersed with other computations before blocking. This gives most of the benefits of spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with "fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking {@link #hasContended} and/or {@link #hasQueuedThreads} to only do so if the synchronizer is likely not to be contended.
FN: If the preferences or nodes in the subtree rooted at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this method, the exported preferences comprise a "fuzzy snapshot" of the subtree; some of the concurrent modifications may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.
FN: . If the preferences at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this method, the exported preferences comprise a "fuzzy snapshot" of the preferences contained in the node; some of the concurrent modifications may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.
FN: The model is allowed to send back notifications to its listeners in any thread, and the listeners must not assume that the notifications will arrive in the UI thread.
FN: DataInputStream is not necessarily safe for multithreaded access.

 this applet that it should stop its execution. It is called when
 the Web page that contains this applet has been replaced by
 another page, and also just before the applet is to be destroyed.

 A subclass of <code>Applet</code> should override this method if
 it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web
 page containing it is no longer visible. For example, an applet
 with animation might want to use the <code>start</code> method to
 resume animation, and the <code>stop</code> method to suspend the
 animation.

 The implementation of this method provided by the
 <code>Applet</code> class does nothing.</p></div>''']
